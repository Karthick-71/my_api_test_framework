# 🚀 Automated API Testing Framework

## 📋 Overview  
This project implements a robust, scalable, and data-driven testing framework for API validation and result analysis. The solution leverages a unified dataset, AWS services, and advanced validation mechanisms to ensure high-quality testing coverage and efficient result management.  

## ✨ Features  
- 🔄 Parameterized API testing with a unified dataset  
- ☁️ AWS service integration (S3 --> Get the test input file and store the test results. Any AWS service can add that support by using boto3.)  
- 📊 Automated test result analysis and reporting  
- ⚙️ Configurable test environments (dev, QA, staging, prod)  
- 🗜️ Comprehensive logging and error handling
